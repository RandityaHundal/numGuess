# numGuess
a simple console c# application where a random number 1 - 100 is generated and you guess it with hints like lower/higher

The program is a simple number guessing game. It generates a random number between 0 and 100. The user is then prompted
to guess this number. If the user's guess is not equal to the generated number, the program enters a loop where it provides hints to the user whether to guess higher or lower. This loop continues until the user guesses the correct number. Once the correct number is guessed, a congratulatory message is displayed. The program then waits for a key press before it closes
